On Quora someone asked _Why is it wrong to think only of yourself?_, and because I liked an answer given by profesor Richard Muller very, very much I had to share this one with you, here's what professor Richard Muller had to say about this topic:


“It's not "wrong".  But when you do that, you deprive yourself of the greatest joys in life.  

Students have come to me wondering "what is the meaning of life". They are discouraged and frustrated and very unhappy.  Why bother working hard?  Why bother "succeeding" when it doesn't really bring happiness?

My first approach to such students is to tell them that their unhappiness is a result of their focus on themselves. Forget yourself, and try helping other people. 

That has been the advice that has been most effective. One of my students tried charity for a local church; he helped prepare food and served it for poor people. He only spent a few hours per week at it, but he told me it changed his life.  For a reason he didn't really understand, he had stopped being so concerned about the meaning of life.”
